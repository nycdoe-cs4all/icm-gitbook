# Introduction to Computational Media

**This curriculum is being revised as we port it to Gitbooks (forgive any formatting issues) - stay tuned for all content to eventually make its way here! **_**If you are viewing this curriculum from Github, we certainly recommend**_ [_**viewing on the much prettier Gitbooks**_](https://cs4all-icm.gitbook.io/introduction-to-computational-media-curriculum/)_**.**_

This curriculum was developed by the [NYCDOE CS4All](http://cs4all.nyc/) academics team (Jos√© Olivares, EJ Park) with lead writer [Luisa Pereira](http://www.luisapereira.net/). Additional contributors to the curriculum include Courtney Morgan üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è & Jos√© Orea (teacher implementation guide and additional activities), Esther Hersh, and the [Processing Foundation](https://processingfoundation.org/). Curricular reorganization, rewrites, and extras developed by Courtney Morgan.

### AP CSP and ICM

While this is an introductory computer science course, it can serve as a terrific AP Computer Science Principles Prep course. Please use the guides below to assist if you are a teacher whose students will eventually take AP CSP, or who is just looking to broaden the content covered within this course:

* [AP CSP/ICM Companion Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ci--4DONVH2xYddqeAq8F4\_RmlgBY\_Tvug56ueWhBj0/preview) (DRAFT - sorry for the mess!)
* [Social Implications of Computing Companion Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GVzOsjulSYxlEj51HJCFeo64VuXrf3aHdA2zH4X8cv8/preview) (DRAFT - sorry for the mess!)

### Curriculum Materials on Peblio

If you use the Peblio Platform, you can find all teacher-facing lessons and materials for the ICM curriculum below. You can find the student-facing version of worksheets [here](https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/index.html).

* [Unit 1: Drawing, Variables, Random](https://demo.peblio.co/profile/CS4ALL/folder/rkzenSqzN)
* [Unit 2: Respond && Draw](https://demo.peblio.co/profile/CS4ALL/folder/B1mL8C2Q4)
* [Unit 3: Loops, Arrays, Media](https://demo.peblio.co/profile/CS4ALL/folder/ry7OAk22N)
* [Unit 4: Motion && Animaton](https://demo.peblio.co/dashboard/CS4ALL/folder/Bya9TUrVI)
* Unit 5: Functions && Abstraction

Peblio pages contain executable code, text, slides, videos and more. They are useful for creating and sharing programming worksheets and documenting programming projects. See this guide for detailed instructions:

* [Computer Science with Ms. Morgan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzotTG3ao\_SipHcrhKGeScQ) - _most of the ICM curriculum presented as YouTube videos, modified for and filmed during pandemic remote learning._
* [The Coding Tr](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA)[ain](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) - _The coding train is an amazing resource for p5 instructional videos. Dan Shiffman is amazing and you can learn anything from his channel._

* Happy Coding Intro to Coding with p5.js and Processing -[15-week Curriculum](https://happycoding.io/teaching/guides/semester)

### Getting Started with p5 Projects

_These projects help you get up and running with p5 very quickly. They include instructions, videos and sample code. You can create the projects in the Peblio workspace as you watch these videos. They are not classroom resources, but resources to help you build your comfort level with p5._

* [Project 1: Drawing Apps](https://demo.peblio.co/pebl/Muth86erj)
* [Project 2: Generative Design](https://demo.peblio.co/pebl/xtShIBrtc)
* [Project 3: Game Design](https://demo.peblio.co/pebl/oqwx-4Zz7)

### Interactive Art: Hour of Code in p5.js

_This hour of code activity introduces drawing with p5 and system variables mouseX and mouseY. If you change the sequence and teach colors after shapes followed by system variables, this is a great project option._
