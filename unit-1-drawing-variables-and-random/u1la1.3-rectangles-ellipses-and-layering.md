# U1LA1.3: Rectangles, Ellipses, and Layering

### Overview && Teacher Feedback

In this learning activity, students will create a visual composition using the p5 shape functions rect\(\) and ellipse\(\). They will continue to build on their understanding of functions and their parameters to recreate the robot from lesson 1.   
This lesson is split into three parts: drawing rectangles, drawing ellipses, and coding the robot. 

In lesson 1, we practiced abstraction with the unplugged robot activity, today they will get the opportunity to code their robot.

The do-now will give students an opportunity to create a new robot \(or multiple robots\) and make revisions to their existing robot. 

Have extra copies of the worksheet because students may make mistakes \(or may have lost their sheet prior to this class\). 

**NB**: There are two activities to practice rectangles and ellipses. Offer multiple opportunities for students to display and explain their work to the class or peers.

Some students may want to add color, but that lesson won’t be introduced until U1LA3.  The student focus should be on drawing using functions from the p5.js library. Trust the process that styling will come later! 

This lesson provides opportunities for pair programming. Please note that paired programming opportunities should always have an equal number of “at-bats” for each student.

### Suggested Duration

~1 period, 45 minutes  
\(This may require some extension depending on how elaborate students were with their robots, but they will come back to this project later!\)

### Assessments

**Formative**: Creating ellipses and positioning, Creating rectangles and positioning  
**Summative**: Coding robot in p5.js, Taijitu symbol

### Do Now/Warm Up

This will be an unplugged activity, it is important to review how to find the positions and sizes of the shapes used to create the robot the drew and deconstructed in lesson U1LA1.1 Ask student to take out their robot worksheet and add or make changes to it.

To review how rectangles and ellipses work in p5 ask students ask the following:

\*Which corner is used to determine the position of a rectangle?   
**\***What two values are used to determine the position of a rectangle?  
\*Is the width and the height of the ellipse a diameter or a radius?
