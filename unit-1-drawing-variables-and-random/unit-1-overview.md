# ðŸ”® Unit 1 Overview

### Overview

In this unit students get acquainted with the p5 canvas coordinate system, drawing shapes and colors on it. Programming concepts covered include calling built-in p5 functions with different parameters, working with variables (both built-in and custom), and using controlled randomness.

Students are introduced to the p5 web editor and practice consulting the p5 online documentation. In the final project, students apply these skills to create an abstract album cover.

### Nota Bene

We do not include a proper Unit 0 in this curriculum - the lessons begin with students thinking about p5.js. However, we strongly recommend planning a Unit 0 for your classroom to allow you to set a positive classroom culture and establish norms with your students.

### NYS && CSTA Standards

**NYS Standards**

* **9-12.CT.5** Modify a function or procedure in a program to perform its computation in a different way over the same inputs, while preserving the result of the overall program.
* **9-12.CT.7** Design or remix a program that utilizes a data structure to maintain changes to related pieces of data.
* **9-12.CT.9** Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior.
* **9-12.CT.10** Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.
* **9-12.DL.1** Type proficiently on a keyboard.
* **9-12.DL.2** Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.

**CSTA Standards**

* **3A-AP-13** Create prototypes that use algorithms to solve computational problems by leveraging prior student knowledge and personal interests.
* **3A-AP-21** Evaluate and refine computational artifacts to make them more usable and accessible.
* **3A-AP-22** Design and develop computational artifacts working in team roles using collaborative tools.

* **3A-CS-03** Develop guidelines that convey systematic troubleshooting strategies that others can use to identify and fix errors.

### Suggested Duration

Duration based class meeting 5x a week with 45 min periods

2 weeks, without class projects \~ 7.5 hrs

3+ weeks, with projects 11.25 hrs

Some classrooms may need more time based on the time allotted to finish various project activities.

### Prerequisites

None - this is the start of the unit! While some students may have some programming experience, we are assuming that they are coming in without any prior programming experience.

### Overview of Instructional Materials

Each learning activity on the curriculum website has been broken down into 1-2 period lessons. The resources below are teacher-facing notes on the suggested implementation for the curriculum; they include structures for content delivery, suggestions for assessment, and resources for each lesson segment. At the end of each learning activity is a slightly longer project to serve as a summative assessment; at the end of the unit, there is an end of unit project.

Teachers should review these materials and use them as they apply to their classroom. This is the suggested implementation, but it should be modified to fit student population, class period constraints, etc.
