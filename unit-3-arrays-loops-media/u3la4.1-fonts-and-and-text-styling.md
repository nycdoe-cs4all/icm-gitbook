# U3LA4.1 Fonts && Text Styling

### Overview && Teacher Feedback

In this learning activity, students draw text with different fonts (both system fonts and custom ones), manipulating their placement, size, and color.

The only new code introduced in this lesson are commands that control text styling - everything else is really about using custom fonts, which involves a little hopping in and out of the HTML. It's VERY IMPORTANT, as with images, that students are extra mindful of making sure they type (and capitalize, and space) everything correctly in their font names, as this is a common way that students will run into errors.&#x20;

This is a really fun time for kids, so enjoy it!

### Vocabulary

* **Font**: A font is a set of printable or displayable text character s in a specific style and size.&#x20;
* **Serif**: Serifs are semi-structural details or small decorative flourishes on the ends of some of the strokes that make up letters and symbols. An example would be the Times New Roman font.&#x20;
* **Sans-serif**: Sans serif does not have these details or flourishes. An example would be the Arial font.
