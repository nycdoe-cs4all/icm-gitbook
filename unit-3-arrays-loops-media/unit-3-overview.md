# ðŸ”® ðŸ”® Unit 3 Overview

### Overview

In this unit, students learn about working with media and asynchronicity. They also explore arrays and loops as ways to organize data and iterate through information. The preload function is used to load image, font, and sound files before sketches are run, and callback functions are introduced. In the final project, students combine images, fonts, and sound to create their own random meme generator.

### Blueprint Foundations Student Outcomes

#### Abstraction

ANALYZE - Describe how I might use patterns to express an idea.

PROTOTYPE

* Describe different things I tried in order to achieve a goal.
* Explain why I chose to include the specific components of my prototype over others.
* Explain the characteristics or patterns that informed a function or an interface I created.

COMMUNICATE - Explain why using patterns is necessary when creating with a computer.

#### Algorithms

ANALYZE - Describe how instructions can have different outputs depending on inputs.

PROTOTYPE

* Demonstrate the benefit of using an event, conditional, or loop in my prototype.
* Explain how a function I prototyped can be used by someone else.
* Suggest changes to an algorithm that impacts my family or my community.

COMMUNICATE

* Compare and contrast how conditionals or loops were used in classmatesâ€™ prototypes.
* Teach someone the difference between instructions and an algorithm.

#### Programming

ANALYZE - Experiment with the commands of a programming language.

PROTOTYPE

* Describe the changes I made after testing at least three parts of my program.
* Describe how I used community research to make technical decisions in the creation of my prototype.

COMMUNICATE - Discuss what can and cannot be done with a specific set of commands.
