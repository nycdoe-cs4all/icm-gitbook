# ðŸ—ƒ ðŸ—ƒU3LA5 Mini Project: Keyboard/Patatap

### Overview/Teacher Feedback

This project comes right before the bigger, end of unit project. As such, it's up to you how large you'd like to make this - feel free to adjust the program requirements to keep it as more of a short, 1-2 period practice and exploration, or scale it up into a full week ordeal. Entirely up to you!

### Prompt

You are going to be tasked with making a program that will be fully interactive and allow the users to play sounds that also correspond to something that happens on the canvas. (Think back to our lesson and the changing face!)&#x20;
