# How to Use this Curriculum

### Overview

This curriculum was built as an introductory high school computer science course. While it can be implemented at any point in high school, it is appropriate for 9th grade and up. It assumes no prior knowledge and focuses on creative expression as a means to learn computational thinking and syntactical concepts.

The curriculum is broken into units, with each unit including lesson arcs (structured as 'learning activities') with many projects and final projects to endcap each unit.

### Pacing

There is no end-of-course exam, so teachers should feel free to adjust pacing to suit the needs of their class. From experience, we believe that the five units in this guide represent a reasonable pace for a year. Finishing Unit 5 also puts students in a great place for follow-up courses such as AP Computer Science Principles.

For students coming in with more experience, there are two optional units that can be shared by request to ensure no gaps in the instructional year.

### Reading

Each Unit is broken into various "learning activities" which are in turn split into various lessons.

Seeing a lesson like this would mean:

**U1LA1.4** --> Unit 1, Learning Activity 1, Lesson 4

Please feel free to adjust the naming conventions to meet the needs of your own classroom!

### Adapting

While we recommend following this course in the intended order, there are some changes that can be made.

This curriculum purposefully keeps functions as an end-of-unit activity to try and keep kids from getting overwhelmed by concepts and syntax early on in the course. If this is not your preferred method of delivery, Unit 5 could be moved to after Unit 2.

Additionally, there are a variety of optional learning activities that contain guidance on when they are best implemented. We strongly encourage teachers to follow any inspiration that strikes them and introduce any and all interesting projects that may come to mind!
