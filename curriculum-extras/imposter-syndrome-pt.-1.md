# Imposter Syndrome (pt. 1)

### When to Use This Extra

This lesson is not code-related, and could be used at any point in the year. It would perhaps be best served at the start of year, mid-year, or after a particularly difficult project or lesson.

### Overview

This lesson is meant to serve as an add-on to any Computer Science course. It does not need a specific coding language - in fact, student computer use is not required as the entire lesson is unplugged - and follows no greater scope and sequence beyond [an optional follow-up lesson](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MOm9XoH41OaPN\_OMkPb3UpWjFo7soKfOt\_Bo3G4fJ2c/preview) that focuses on digital contributors to Imposter Syndrome. As such, it can be delivered at any point during the year. A suggestion would be to consider using this lesson to begin or end a particularly difficult topic or project, or at the end of a strenuous week.

Built on the RULER approach, the goal of this lesson is to start guiding students to recognize and understand Imposter Syndrome and work towards being able to label, with specific language, their own feelings, express them in a way that is appropriate to the situation, and regulate with some of the presented strategies. While lessons on Imposter Syndrome could be a part of many content areas, we believe it is especially important in Computer Science classrooms where students are often struggling with a brand new and potentially difficult content area.

The lesson comes with a significant amount of resources and teachers are encouraged to select the ones that they think will resonate the most with their students.

### Objectives

Students will be able to:

* Define imposter syndrome&#x20;
* Recognize when they are feeling imposter syndrome&#x20;
* Understand the specific causes and consequences of their imposter syndrome&#x20;
* Work towards labeling with specific language their feelings, expressing them in a situationally appropriate manner, and regulating with suggested strategies.

### Suggested Duration

45 Minutes (\~1 Class Period)

_This lesson could certainly be extended for two class periods to allow more time for student discussion. Additionally, suggestions are given on ways to continue promoting the strategies presented in the lesson over the course of the regular curriculum._

### **Assessments**

_There are no formal assessments in this lesson, however, students will be asked to write affirmations for themselves and other students to use when imposter syndrome strikes. This could be used as a participation grade._

### **Do Now/Warm Up (\~2-3 Minutes)**

Display on board: Take two minutes to briefly journal your feelings on this class - how have you felt about what youâ€™ve been learning about and making? What sort of mood/energy/vibe do you usually come into class with?

Feel free to modify this question as you see fit based on what your class has been working on, or what they may need
