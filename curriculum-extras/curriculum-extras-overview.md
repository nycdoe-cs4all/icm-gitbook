# ðŸ”® Curriculum Extras Overview

This section contains optional lessons and mini projects that can be implemented in the curriculum at the discretion of the teacher. Each optional lesson has a suggested placement, but can truly be inserted anywhere thereafter as a means to make projects that are more interesting, or to fill some time before an awkwardly placed break (or similar).

Currently under construction with lessons coming soon!
