# Submit Feedback

### We want to hear from you!

The ICM Curriculum is maintained primarily by two members of the CS4All High School academic team and has been through several iterations and rewrites, which is to say, there are probably typos, broken links, and bugs hidden somewhere in these pages that we have not found yet. **If you find an issue, please let us know so that we can fix it!**

We also welcome any questions, comments, philosophies, theories, or general feedback from folks using our curriculum. We are always striving to make these resources better (and are even brainstorming an ICM 2.0 that can be inclusive of even more NYS CS standards!) and your feedback helps that to happen.

#### [If you have something to share with us, please submit any issues and other feedback using this form.](https://forms.gle/Z9e65jgRRpABa53N7) We will do our best to fix any issues and get back to your questions and comments as soon as we are able!
