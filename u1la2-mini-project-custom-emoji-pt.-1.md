# ðŸ—ƒ ðŸ—ƒU1LA2 Mini Project: Custom Emoji pt. 1

### Overview && Teacher Feedback

In this project, students will use all of the concepts that they have been practicing from LA #1 and LA #2. They are also asked to write a prompt explaining why their emoji should be added to the Unicode Consortium.

This project is a culminating assessment or practice for learning activity 2. It focuses on a studentâ€™s creative use of variables, random, and a digital citizen perspective. Some options for implementation are in class lab time, at home projects, and class presentations. This is a great opportunity to build a positive and collaborative classroom culture.

### Objectives

Students should be able to:

* Use system variables&#x20;
* Use custom variables&#x20;
* Utilize random() function&#x20;
* Create a digital image for an audience&#x20;
* Defend and validate their creations

### Suggested Duration

1 \~ 2 period(s) (45 \~ 90 minutes)

_If students are focused and working, you can allow for as much time as you'd like for them to make something they're happy with!_

### Do Now/Warm Up (5 - 8 min.)

Share students this Emoji Day Video video.

Introduce the project prompt and read it with your students

Ask students:

* What is your favorite emoji and why?&#x20;
* What would a world without emojis be like?&#x20;
* How do emojis influence our society?&#x20;
* Are emojis harmful or beneficial to society?

### Lab Time

Allow time for students to brainstorm their ideas in a group, as pairs or whole class discussion.

Ask students to:

Write down 3 ideas without sharing with anyone for 3 mins Share their ideas with your peers Pick and finalize one idea

Teachers should circulate and make notes of struggling students for conferencing or remediation. Students should be adding comments to their code to differentiate each shape they are making and where it -should- be appearing. If youâ€™d like students can pair up and give feedback on comments and emoji creation.

### Wrap Up

Ask students to present their work as a class in groups of 4. If your students want to see everyone's emoji then have a gallery walk where students can use post its to add feedback and comments.

### Extensions

Some students may finish early, have them go through the p5.js reference and add color to their emojis.
