# ðŸ”® Unit 2 Overview

### Overview

In this unit, students learn to make their sketches respond to actions taken by the user, from moving the pointer to clicking or touching it over a certain area, to typing on the keyboard. The if statement is introduced. The map function is used to convert inputs into useful ranges.

For the final project, students create an expressive drawing tool in the vein of MS Paint.

### Blueprint Foundations Student Outcomes

**Abstraction**

* Describe how I might use patterns to express an idea.
*   Describe different things I tried in order to achieve a goal.

    Explain why I chose to include the specific components of my prototype over others.

    Explain characteristics or patterns that informed a function or an interface I created.
* Explain why using patterns is necessary when creating with a computer.

**Algorithms**

* Describe how instructions can have different outputs depending on inputs.
*   Demonstrate the benefit of using an event, conditional or loop in my prototype.

    Explain how a function I prototyped can be used by someone else.

    Suggest changes to an algorithm that impacts my family or my community.
*   Compare and contrast how conditionals or loops were used in classmatesâ€™ prototypes.

    Teach someone the difference between instructions and an algorithm.

**Programming**

* Experiment with the commands of a programming language.
*   Describe the changes I made after testing at least three parts of my program.

    Describe how I used community research to make technical decisions in the creation of my prototype.
* Discuss what can and cannot be done with a specific set of commands.
