# ðŸ—ƒ ðŸ—ƒ U4LA.1: Make a Floating DVD Logo

### Prompt

If youâ€™ve ever let a device sit idle while itâ€™s plugged into something like a laptop, DVD/Blu-ray player, game console, or even watched a Smartboard, youâ€™ve noticed that the people behind those hardware systems have made a â€˜default screenâ€™ to display when nothing is happening. Sometimes, this is just a static logo - but in the best versions, it is a logo that moves around the screen. This can be pretty enjoyable to watch, and pretty distracting, as you can see from [this example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOtuX0jL85Y).

Using what you know about animation, you are going to create a simple DVD screensaver (or any device really) with a logo to send bouncing around the screen.

Your project should have and do the following:

* Have a basic logo made of several p5 shapes, or multiple images, or multiple lines of text, or a mix of all three. It should not be just a single shape/image/text line!&#x20;
* When you hit play, the shape should begin moving around the screen.
* &#x20;If the shape gets to an edge, it should bounce back and travel in a different direction. (It can absolutely change speed when it picks this new direction!)

**Writing Prompt:**

Pick one conditional statement used in your program. Using comments, explain what it does and how/why it works.

### Extensions

Since we are on a computer and not just a TV monitor or smartboard, letâ€™s make this more interactive!

* Make your logo interact with the mouse - when the mouse touches the logo, it should change directions.&#x20;
* Alternately, see if you can figure out if you can get the logo to â€˜chaseâ€™ the mouse!&#x20;
* You can also try to make something other than direction change with your shape!
