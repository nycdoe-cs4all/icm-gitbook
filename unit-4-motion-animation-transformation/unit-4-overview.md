# ðŸ”® ðŸ”® Unit 4 Overview

### Overview

This unit covers the fundamentals of creating motion in a program by using incrementing variables as well as how to utilize transformations and sine/cosine to move and shift their shapes. It continues to build off of knowledge acquired in the first 3 units.

The final project is very opened ended and asks students to showcase the skills gained in this unit as well as all skills they have learned previously.

### Blueprint Foundational Student Standards

\[Coming Soon]

### Suggested Duration

13-22 Days _(Dependent on how much time you allocate to final projects and lessons that have the option to go longer)_

### Assessments

Formative Assessments are given during each lesson.&#x20;

Summative Assessments include:

**Mini Projects:** DVD Logo

**Final Projects:** Animated PSA/Greeting Card

### Overview of Instructional Materials

Below we have broken each learning activity down into succinct lessons. We have also structured lessons to promote best practices in pedagogy and student engagement, as well as including our own suggestions for implementation.
